// When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
// In the browser, the document object is a fundamental part of the Document Object Model (DOM). 
// It represents the web page currently loaded in the browser and provides a way to 
// interact with and manipulate its content.

// The DOM abstracts the structure of the document into a tree of objects, allowing scripts to 
// manipulate the content and structure dynamically. 
// This abstraction enables more complex interactions and functionalities beyond just static HTML.


console.log(document);
console.log(document.head);
console.log(`title is : ${document.title}`);
